          //- Replace the boilerplate below with your best elevator pitch
          p My name is Stephan, but you can call me Steve. I am a happy father of one, soon to be two. I'm a building automation technician by day, and an aspiring Full Stack JavaScript developer by night. All my life, I've felt at home in front of a computer, and I would love to take that passion and turn it into a full time career. Thank you for taking the time to view my portfolio.
