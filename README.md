# FSJS-Project-6
### My Portfolio

 
#### Description

  This repository was designed for the Treehouse TechDegree course, Project-6: My Portfolio

  This project is complete, and I am hoping to obtain an "Exceeds Expectations" grade based on the grading key provided.

  This project uses pre-made CSS and JavaScipt files. It was my task to create the app.js file using Express, and create the HTML files using Pug. I also had to create a static JSON file that the data for the project was pulled from. 

  The objective of this app is to create a portfolio displaying the past projects in the Full-Stack JavaScript course, and to learn about using Express, Pug, and the terminal. 

#### Exceeds Expectations Explained

 Customize package.json - 
 package.json is setup so that running npm start will run the app.

 Render Error Pug Files - 
 Two files were created, error.pug and not-found.pug. These pages will only be displayed when the relative error has occured, with a dynamic message depending on the error status and message.

 Customize the Style - 
 I made a few style adjustments, first to the background colour of the app. Then because of the different background colours, I adjusted the colour of the font for better contrast with the background. Finally, I added some CSS at the  bottom of styles.css to enlarge the project pictures on index.pug when the mouse cursor hovers over the picture.

#### Outside Resources

 I did have to do a google search when adding in the CSS to enlarge the project pictures. I referenced the following page from [appen](https://success.appen.com/hc/en-us/articles/202703155-CSS-Guide-to-Enlarge-Images-on-Hover). I did make slight adjustments to the sizing, as well as added a transition time of 0.5s.

#### Frameworks Used
